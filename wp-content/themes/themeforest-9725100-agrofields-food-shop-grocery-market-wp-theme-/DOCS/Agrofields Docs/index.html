		<h3>Install Your Theme</h3><hr class="notop">
		<p>Before installing the theme, you need to install WordPress (see details <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress">here</a>). Once you have installed WordPress and logged in to admin panel, you can install <strong>Agrofields theme</strong>.</p>
		
		<div class="warning">
			<p><strong><p style="color:#FF6B6B;">Important!</p> Before using the theme, please make sure you have followed an instruction described below.</strong></p>
			
			<p>After you have installed WordPress, find the htaccess.php file on your server, please open it and add (to the very end of the file) the following code:</p>
			
			<pre>
				php_value post_max_size 16M
				php_value upload_max_filesize 16M
				php_value max_file_uploads 32M
				php_value max_input_vars 5000
			</pre>
			
			<p>This is needed for many parts of theme functionlaity to function correctly. Please make sure you do this BEFORE installing and activating the theme, if you are installing it via Admin panel, and always BEFORE uploading any demo content.</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>There are two ways to install the theme</p>
			
		<ol>
			<li>Upload via WordPress admin panel.
			<li>Upload via FTP directly to your server.
		</ol>
		<p>Once your theme is installed, you will be able to customize it by yourself from scratch, or use our Demo Content (see more about it in the relevant chapter).</p>


<!-- ________ Subsection _____________________Installation via Admin -->		
		<h5>1. Upload the theme using WordPress admin panel</h5>
		
		
		<p>To upload theme using WP admin panel, please proceed to <strong>Appearance > Themes</strong>.</p>
		<div><img src="images/install-admin.png" alt="" /></div>

		<div class="warning">
			<p><strong>Important!</strong></p>
			
			<p>Please make sure you are not choosing the entire theme archive you have downloaded from Themeforest, you should use only the theme archive - <strong>agrofields.zip</strong>.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div><img src="images/install-admin-install.png" alt="" /></div>
				
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> To perform the requested action, WordPress needs to access your web server, so when you'll get to uploading the theme, please enter your FTP credentials. If you do not remember your credentials, you should contact your web host.</p>
			
		<p>Once the installation process is finished, click &ldquo;Activate&rdquo;.</p>
		<div><img src="images/14.png" alt="" /></div>


<!-- ________ Subsection _____________________Installation via FTP -->		
		<h5>2. Upload theme via FTP</h5>
		
		<p>To upload your theme to via FTP, you need to unzip and copy all the files from &ldquo;agrofields&rdquo; folder to <strong>wp-content/themes/agrofields</strong> directly on the server (use only lower case letters!).</p> 
		<div><img src="images/install-ftp-upload.png" alt="" /></div>
		
		<p>After you did that, Agrofields theme will be available for activation in WP admin panel: Appearance - Themes. Activate it by clicking &ldquo;Activate&rdquo;. <br><strong>Note:</strong> before activating disable all your plugins.</p>
		
		
		<div class="warning">

			<ol>
				<li>There are NO NESTED FOLDERS like:<br> <i>/wp-content/themes/agrofields/agrofields</i>.<br>
				    A correct path will look like:<br> <i>/wp-content/themes/agrofields</i>.</li>
			
				<li>You SHOULDN'T copy entire theme archive you have downloaded from Themeforest to your server - only unzipped <strong>agrofields.zip</strong>.</li>
				
				<li>DO NOT rename the theme on your server. Theme names like <i>/wp-content/themes/agrofields1</i> or any other are INAPPROPRIATE. Please make sure the theme folder is called <i>themes/agrofields</i>.</li>
				
				<li>Use only lower case letters.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<p>If you've faced an error in the process of theme activation, please, make sure you have followed our instructions carefully. Your server settings may restrict some theme features, so you can try contacting your hosting support for help. If the issue persists, <strong>disable all plugins</strong> and try again.

	<h3>Adding Plugins</h3><hr class="notop">
		<p>Your theme archive comes with several plugins.</p>
		<ul><strong>
			<li>CMSMS Visual Content Composer

			<li>CMSMS Mega Menu
			<li>iLightbox
			<li>Revolution Slider

			<p> if you are planning to upload <strong>Demo Content</strong> that comes in the theme archive, you need to <strong>INSTALL ALL PLUGINS!!!</strong></p>
			
			<p>Other plugins are alternative to use, but we do recommend also using the <strong>CMSMS Contact Form Builder</strong> (lets you create great contact forms). You can as well use one or both sliders to add a slider to your website.</p>
			
			<p>Use WooCommerce plugin if you need to sell your products online.</p>

			
		</div>
		
		<p>After your theme is installed and activated, it will remind you about installing the <strong>required</strong> and <strong>recommended</strong> plugins. You will see the following notice across your Dashboard:</p>

		<div class="warning">
		
			<h5><font color="#ff0000"><strong>Important:</strong></font></h5>
			<p>you should have <strong>"777" access settings</strong> for the <strong>wp-content</strong> folder before installation. <br>You can change these permissions back to 755 when the installation is finished.</p>

			Open a drop-down menu by clicking the right mouse on the folder, specified above. <br>Choose there "access rights" (or maybe something similar - depends on your FTP client) and make changes. </p>
			
			<p>Don't apply this action for the subfolders and nested files.</p>
		
			<p>Please don't set the "777" permissions  "agrofields"  folder for security reasons. Also please change the permissions for "wp-content" folder back to 755 when you are done.</p>

		<h3>Upload Demo Content</h3><hr class="notop">
		
		<div class="warning">
		
			<h5><font color="#ff0000"><strong>Important:</strong></font></h5>
			<p>Before uploading <strong>Demo Content</strong> please make sure you have installed and activated <strong>ALL 6 PLUGINS</strong> that came with the theme. You may reference <strong>"Plugins Installation"</strong> section of this guide for more information.</p>
						
		</div>
			
		<p>To add a Demo content you need to install <strong>WordPress Importer plugin</strong>.</p>
		<p>In your admin panel proceed to<strong>Tools - Import</strong></p>
		<p>And then choose <strong>WordPress Importer</strong> tool:</p>
		<div><img src="images/demo-content-importer.png" alt="" /></div>
		
		<div  class="warning">
			 <h5><font color="#ff0000"><strong>Important:</strong></font></h5>
			 <p>You should have <strong>"777" access settings</strong> for the <strong>wp-content</strong> folder before this plugin intallation. <br>Otherwise your demo content won't be installed. <br>You may change these permissions back to 755 when the installation is finished.</p>
			<p>You can do it using your <strong>FTP client</strong> or <strong>C-panel</strong>. See how to set the permissions in more details in <a class="current" href="#add_plugins">Plugin Installation</a> section.</p>
		</div>
		
				
		<h4>Step One - <strong>Import the Content Itself</strong>:</h4>
		
		<p>Demo Content files can be found in the archive you have downloaded from Themeforest. Open the DEMO CONTENT folder, then choose one of the demo websites from which you would like to import settings and content. Each of the folders will include a .xml content import file, a .txt theme settings file and one or more slider import files.</p>
		
		<p>First please proceed to <strong>Tools - Import</strong> and choose Wordpress Importer, then browse for the .xml demo content file on your computer and click the Upload button:</p>	
		<div><img src="images/demo-content-upload.png" alt="" /></div>
		
		<p>Please make sure to mark the checkbox as shown on the screenshot below, then click "Submit":</p>	
		<div><img src="images/demo-content-submit.png" alt="" /></div>
		
				
		<p>Don't close this browser tab until the installation is finished. Be patient - it may take few minutes.</p>
			
		<p>The WordPress Importer plugin, which adds DEMO content,  adds <strong>content</strong> only - i.e., posts, pages, menus, images. It will not import Theme Settings. Theme settings will be imported separately in the second step.</p>
			
		<div class="warning"><h5><font color="#ff0000"><strong>Note:</strong></font></h5> 
			<p>1. Demo content adds all the posts and pages just like we have on our demo site, but all the images are substituted with placeholders. Our license does not allow us redistribute images, but quite sure you will find tons of great images on photodune.net - <strong><a href="http://photodune.net/&ref=cmsmasters">Visit Photodune Now</a></strong>.</p>
			
			<p>2. After you have imported Theme Settings and Demo Content, you need to <strong> choose your homepage</strong> and your <strong>navigation</strong> <i>(see instructions for both below)</i>.</p>
			
			<p>3. Should there be any difficulties or questions, please feel free to contact our support, we are always glad to help you - <strong><a href="http://cmsmasters.net/support/">http://cmsmasters.net/support</a></strong>.</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<h4>Step Two - <strong>Import Theme Settings</strong>:</h4>
		<p>Now you can import theme settings, as they are different for all demo sites. In your theme archive see the DEMO CONTENT folder and open the folder, you want to use content from. Then open the .txt file with the theme settings. Copy all the code in this file:</p>	
		<div><img src="images/demo-content-settings-copy.png" alt="" /></div>
		
		<p>Now proceed to <strong>Theme Settings - Import/Export  - Import</strong> tab and paste the code you have copied into the field provided, then click "Import Settings" button:</p>	
		<div><img src="images/demo-content-settings-paste.png" alt="" /></div>
		
		<h4>Step Three - Choose your <strong>Home Page</strong> and <strong>Navigation</strong>:</h4>
		
		<p>To set your Home Page please proceed to <strong>Settings  - Reading</strong> and set a <strong>Static Page</strong> as a home page, then use a drop-down to find and assign a specific page. You should choose "Home":</p>	
		<div><img src="images/demo-content-home.png" alt="" /></div>
		
		<p>You also need to assign your navigation. The menu was already imported to your website, but you just need to set it in <strong>Appearance - Menus - Manage Locations</strong>.  Choose <strong>Main Menu</strong> as Primary Navigation and save changes. There might also be a need to assign other menus too, if they are present on the website you are replicating.</p>	
		<div><img src="images/demo-content-menu.png" alt="" /></div>
		
		<h4>Step Four - <strong>Import Sliders</strong>:</h4>
		
		<p>The final step to replicate a demo site will be importing the sliders. The sliders import files are included in the archive you have downloaded from Themeforest in a Demo Content folder:</p>	
		<div><img src="images/demo-content-sliders-files.png" alt="" /></div>
		
		<p>Some of the demo sites can have both Layer and Revolution fles to import, some may have only one of them. In any case, you need to the .zip archive that is located inside. </p>
		
		<p>To import slider demo content you need to proceed to the slider tab on your admin panel and import the .zip file. See a screenshot for the Layer Slider import:</p>
		<div><img src="images/demo-content-sliders.png" alt="" /></div>
		
		<p>See the same procedure for Revolution Slider:</p>
		<div><img src="images/demo-content-sliders-revo.png" alt="" /></div>
		
		<div class="warning"><h5><font color="#ff0000"><strong>Note:</strong></font></h5> 
			<p>1. Please make sure you are using a corresponding import archive. <br /> For instance, use a file from a LayerSlider folder to import in Layer Slider plugin and a file form a Revolution Slider folder to import into a Revolution Slider .</p>
			
			<p>2. Please note that the slider import file will import all slider settings, slides, layers, captions and animation effects, but with all images substituted with placeholders.</p>
			
			<p>3. Should there be any difficulties or questions, please feel free to contact our support, we are always glad to help you - <strong><a href="http://cmsmasters.net/support/">http://cmsmasters.net/support</a></strong>.</p>

<!-- __________________________________________________ Appearance Settings -->		
	<section id="appearance_settings">
	
		<h3>Appearance Settings</h3><hr class="notop">
		
		<p>Agrofields theme provides really flexible appearance settings. <br>One of the main features, are <strong>Color Schemes</strong>.</p>
		
		
		<h4>1. Color Schemes</h4>
		<p><strong>Color Schemes</strong> allow you create preset color solutions that subsequently can be applied when editing your website content, like menus, various shortcodes etc.</p>
		
		<p>Color schemes can be set up and edited In <strong>Theme Settings - Colors</strong> tab in your admin panel.</p>
		
		<p>Initially the theme comes with the 9 schemes (but you can add more, we will get to this below in this section), which are:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Default</strong> - applied to most of the Body content, unless other is specified</li>
				<li><strong>Header</strong> - applied to Header, but can be used for other website sections as well</li>
				<li><strong>Header Top</strong> - applied to Header Top Line, but can be used for other website sections as well</li>
				<li><strong>Footer</strong> - applied to Footer, but can be used for other website sections as well</li>
				<li><strong>Custom 1</strong> - is used for various elements upon your choice</li>
				<li><strong>Custom 2</strong> - is used for various elements upon your choice</li>
				<li><strong>Custom 3</strong> - is used for various elements upon your choice</li>
				<li><strong>Custom 3</strong> - is used for various elements upon your choice</li>
				<li><strong>Custom 4</strong> - is used for various elements upon your choice</li>
			</ul>
			
		<p>Please see the screenshot:</p>
		<div><img src="images/settings-color-schemes.png" alt="" /></div>
		
		<p>Each color scheme offers a list of options, that altogether make a really flexible design instrument. For instance, any of your pages can be created of several sections, and a unique color scheme can be assigned to each section.</p>
		
		<h5>Add More Color Schemes</h5>
		<p>If you feel like these 9 schemes are yet not enough for you, you can easily add more custom color schemes. For this please proceed to <strong>Appearance - Editor</strong> and choose Theme Functions to edit <i>functions.php</i> file.</p>
		
		<p>Then scroll to where it says <strong>"Theme Settings Custom Color Schemes"</strong> and copy one of the lines to place it right below the other ones, then rename it. After you save the file, your new color scheme will be available for editing in <strong>Theme Settings  - Colors</strong>. See the screenshot:</p>
		<div><img src="images/settings-color-add.png" alt="" /></div>
		
		<h4>2. Font Settings</h4>
		
		<p>All website font settings can be edited in <strong>Theme Settings  - Fonts</strong> tab. you can find settings for general content, links, navigation, headings and some other elements. To customize your website appearance, just play around with the font settings, or leave theme default if you wish. See the screenshot:</p>
		<div><img src="images/settings-fonts.png" alt="" /></div>
		
		<p>Yet, Agrofields theme allows you to add any of hundreds Google fonts and se them on your website. Just follow a guide below</p>
		
				
		<h5>Add more google Fonts</h5>
		
		<p>For this please proceed to <strong>Appearance - Editor</strong> and choose Theme Functions to edit <i>functions.php</i> file.</p>
		
		<p>Click to edit the file and scroll to where it says:</p>	
		
		<pre>// Theme Settings Google Fonts List</pre>
		
		<p>See the screenshot:</p>
		<div><img src="images/settings-fonts-editor.png" alt="" /></div>		
	
		<div class="warning">
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> 	Please be attentive and do not use the Theme Settings System Fonts List instead - you can not load any Google font to this list.</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>You should add a new font to this list manually.<br>	To paste it you should get the details from here:</p>
		<div><img src="images/settings-fonts-new.png" alt="" /> </div>

		<p>Don't forget to choose your font style and character sets:</p>
		<div><img src="images/settings-fonts-weight.png" alt="" /> </div>

		<p>Copy this code:</p>
		<div><img src="images/settings-fonts-copy.png" alt="" /> </div>
		
		<p>It's <i>Monda:400,700&subset=latin,latin-ext'</i> in our example.</p>
		
		<p>Paste it to the code so it looks like this:</p>
        <div><img src="images/settings-fonts-paste.png" alt="" /> </div>

        <div class="warning">
			<p><strong>Important:</strong> Important: if the font you are using has only one weight value, for instance - 400, the given by Google code will not list this value, in this case you need to add the weight value to the code you are adding manually.
			See an example for Fenix font: </p>
			<div><img src="images/google-font.png" alt="" /> </div>
			<p>The offered code for it will look like this: </p>
			<div><img src="images/google-font-2.png" alt="" /> </div>
			<h5>Instead of adding only: Fenix&subset=latin,latin-ext<br> you need to add: Fenix:400&subset=latin,latin-ext</h5>
		</div>
		
		
		<h5>Website Background</h5>
		
		<p>You can set background (color or image) for the whole website, but only if <strong>Boxed</strong> layout is enabled. Boxed layout can be enabled in Theme <strong>Settings  - General</strong> tab:</p>

		<div><img src="images/menu-mega-sub-one.png"></div>
		
		<div class="warning">
			<h5><strong>Please note:</strong></h5>
			<p>Color settings will be applied to column names only if highlight is enabled.</p>
		</div>
		
		
		<p>Finally <strong>second sub level</strong> menu elements will be your actual links that are arranged into columns. You can as well add some text to Description field and enable a checkbox shown on the screenshot. In such a way you will have a text block inside your menu.</p>
		<div><img src="images/menu-mega-sub-two.png"></div>

		<h3>Translate your website</h3><hr class="notop">
		
		<p>There are no ready language files, but you need to take only a few steps to translate your website to the needed language. You can translate the theme to any language, as well as RTL Language.</p>
		<p>It's RTL ready, so you may add a plugin and change the theme content to be shown as RTL.</p>
		
		<p>The first step you should take is create your own language file. To implement this you should install Poedit:</p>
        <div><a href="http://www.poedit.net/"> www.poedit.net</a></div>
		<p>Copy agrofields.pot file to your computer.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> You will find the language pot file in wp-content/themes/agrofields/framework/languages.</p>

        <p>Run Poedit and proceed to <i>File/New catalog from POT file</i>.</p>
		
		<div><img src="images/translations-1.png"></div>
		
		<p>Choose the .pot file you've copied to use as a skeleton of your language. You'll get the list of messages and common phrases. </p>
	    <p>Select a text you'd like to translate onto your language and enter changes in a lower field as shown on the screenshot:</p>
		<div><img src="images/translations-2.png"></div>
		
		<p>You should enter new text to the field in the bottom of the window - it will be saved for each item automatically. Edit all the messages you need and make sure you save changes to the file before closing. 
		<br>Create a language file (for instance the lg_LG file or any other name to your preference). The program will create two files with similar names with resolutions .po and .mo.</p>

        <p>When translation is finished and saved, copy these two files to your server: wp-content/themes/agrofields/framework/languages. Add the new file's name to your wp-config.php file inside the empty quotes in the line: </p>
		
		<pre>                define('WPLANG', ");
		to make it look like this:
		define('WPLANG', 'lg_LG');</pre>
		
		<p>In this line lg_LG is a sample code of any language you'd like to set.</p>

        <div class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> Don't enter a file type to the line. For instance, <code>define('WPLANG', 'lg_LG.po')</code> is incorrect!
		</div>

        <p>Here is a list of language codes examples that can be used:
        <br><b>de_DE</b> for German translation
        <br><b>fr_FR</b> for French translation
        <br><b>it_IT</b> for Italian translation
        <br><b>pt_PT</b> for Portuguese translation
        <br><b>es_ES</b> for Spanish translation
        <br><b>ru_RU</b> for Russian translation
        <br>etc.</p>

        <p>You can use letters or numbers to name your language, just make sure you add the same name to wp-config file.</p>
		
        <p>In a case of need you can edit the fles you have created, just open a lg_LG.po with Poedit. You will get a list like this:</p>
        <div><img src="images/translations-3.png"></div>
